Hi julesontheroad, sorry I did not find any other way of contacting you. First of all congratulations to the really great software, I really like it very much. 
Since SX OS does not release any newer versions I sometimes need to patch nsp files for my latest firmware which is 10.0.4.  
Do you see any chance to get an option to patch to 10.0.4??? 

Thanks a lot
